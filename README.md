# Personal-Software-Infrastructure
## The Problem
I constantly have new ideas for exciting personal projects and fun tools. However, I am always turned away by the thought of another arduous process of setting up the entire environment for my personal projects. Through my passion for automation, I decided to make a project out of solving this problem.

## The Solution
Over the coming year, I will be developing a robust infrastructure and processes that will streamline the process of kickstarting development of a personal project or tool. Here are a few aspects of this project:
- A simple blog documenting my progress üòÅ
- A full user interface for creating and hosting new projects. With nothing but the selection of a frontend, backend, database, and app name, I will be able to create and host an entire new project through subdomains of my personal domain (lakelonbailey.com).
- A dockerized build that allows me to easily scale this infrastructure from my home server to a cloud provider if necessary.
- A full Single Sign-on (SSO) system, complete with user groups and access restrictions/regulations, that integrates with all projects I create through this infrastructure.

## The Result
While I understand there are already existing technologies to accomplish many of the tasks involved with this project, I want to build this infrastructure from the ground up to develop further experience with containerization, cybersecurity, networking, and automation. When successfull, I will have created an infrastructure that will support my passion for development for years to come.

## The Future
Currently, this project is little more than an idea. There is a ton I don't know and a ton to plan, but I'm as motivated as ever. Follow along to watch me learn and grow while building something great from the ground up!
